## Local use
To start the bot and its action server in *production mode*:
```sh
docker compose up
```
The [`Dockerfile.actions`](Dockerfile.actions) is used to inject dependencies (with [`requirements-actions.txt`](requirements-actions.txt)).


## CI/CD

### Model
If something has been modified in the chatbot data file after a `push`, a new model is trained and a docker image is build using the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile) then sent to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com)

### Action Server
If python code has been modified in the `app/actions/` folder after a `push`, the code is verified (lint + types) with commands defined in the [`Makefile`](Makefile). Then the action server docker image is also build and sent to DockerHub.
